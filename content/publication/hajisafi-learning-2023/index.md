abstract: Forecasting the number of visits to Points-of-Interest (POI) in an urban
  area is critical for planning and decision-making for various application domains,
  from urban planning and transportation management to public health and social studies.
  Although this forecasting problem can be formulated as a multivariate time-series
  forecasting task, the current approaches cannot fully exploit the ever-changing
  multi-context correlations among POIs. Therefore, we propose Busyness Graph Neural
  Network (BysGNN), a temporal graph neural network designed to learn and uncover
  the underlying multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting.
  Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to learn a dynamic graph,
  BysGNN utilizes all contextual information and time-series data to learn an accurate
  dynamic graph representation. By incorporating all contextual, temporal, and spatial
  signals, we observe a significant improvement in our forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art
  forecasting models in our experiments with real-world datasets across the United
  States.
