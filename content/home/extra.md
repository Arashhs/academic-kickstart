### High School Student Council President

I was the Student Council President during my senior years at *Khaje Nasir High School* and tried
to do my best to bring everyone together and help the students to exert 100% of their abilities
while growing together as a team and experiencing the joy of learning.

### Website Moderator and Video Content Creator

I was one the website moderators and video content creators at GameemaG back in 2013.
GameemaG was one of the most credible websites focused on the video games industry in Iran,
which had become one of the most engaging community hubs among Persian speaking gamers
due to its fast and comprehensive news, reviews and previews. In 2016, the websiteâ€™s name
changed to [VGMag](https://vgmag.ir/%d8%af%d8%b1%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%b1%d9%87-%d9%85%d8%a7/). I was responsible for moderating the website as well as the discussion board
and creating video content for the site.
