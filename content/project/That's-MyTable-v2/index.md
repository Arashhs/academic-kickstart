That's MyTable V2 is a Java Spring MVC and Hibernate project used for the implementation of my Software Engineering (I) project for table booking and food reservations in a restaurant.
- Forked from [That's MyTable!](https://github.com/ekta2391/Thats-MyTable-Restaurant-Table-Booking-Web-Application), a Github repository on which we applied different software evolution and maintenance techniques to adapt the project with newer versions of Java and Spring framework and added many new functionalities such as food reservations and a better implementation for table booking and time management as well as fixing numerous bugs
- Re-wrote the entire database from the ground up to adapt it with new functionalities
